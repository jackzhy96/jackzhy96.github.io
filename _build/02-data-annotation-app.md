## Technical Details

- Developed user-friendly GUI using PyQt5
- Implemented efficient labeling workflows for multi-modal data
- Supported various annotation types for task descriptions (phase, step, gesture and events)
- Integrated with data collection pipeline for seamless workflow

## Application

This tool is used to annotate the large-scale ex-vivo dataset for tool-tissue contact detection research.

**More details will be added later. Stay tuned!**
