## Overview

Design and implementation of a custom capacitive contact sensor to obtain ground truth data for tool-tissue contact detection in surgical robotics research.

## Technical Details

- Designed capacitive sensing circuitry
- Developed PCB layout for integration with surgical instruments
- Implemented signal processing for contact detection
- Validated sensor performance with tissue phantoms

## Application

This sensor is used to provide ground truth labels for multi-modal deep learning approaches to contact detection.
