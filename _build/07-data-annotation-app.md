## Overview

Design and development of a novel data annotation application with a graphical user interface using PyQt for efficient manual label annotations in surgical robotics research.

## Technical Details

- Developed user-friendly GUI using PyQt5
- Implemented efficient labeling workflows for multi-modal data
- Supported various annotation types (bounding boxes, keypoints, semantic labels)
- Integrated with data collection pipeline for seamless workflow

## Application

This tool is used to annotate the large-scale ex-vivo dataset for tool-tissue contact detection research.
