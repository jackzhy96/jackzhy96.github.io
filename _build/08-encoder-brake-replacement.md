## Overview

Development of novel replacement solutions for defective joint encoders and brakes on dVRK robotic arms, addressing common hardware failures in aging da Vinci systems.

## Technical Details

- Diagnosed common encoder failure modes
- Developed replacement encoder solutions compatible with dVRK controllers
- Designed brake replacement procedures

## PSM Joint Encoder Repair

The replacement solution has been verified to work on the second joint of the dVRK PSM.

**Note:** Our selection is just a workable solution, but not the only one. Also, you will need to manufacture a coupling component (we used aluminum) to better fit your rotation shaft leveraging your machine shop skills. For the encoder we have fixed, the inner diameter is 3mm.

We used <a href="https://www.usdigital.com/products/encoders/incremental/kit/e2?q=E2-4000-315-IE-H-D-B" target="_blank">E2 encoder</a> from US Digital with following configurations:
- CPR: 4000
- Bore Size: 10 mm
- INDEX: index(IE)
- Cover: Through-Hole (H)
- Base: Default (D)

**More details will be added later. Stay tuned!**

## ECM Brake Replacement

Replace the brake for the second joint of the dVRK ECM.
