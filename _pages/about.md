As a fourth-year PhD candidate in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am passionate about developing innovative solutions for exoskeleton and surgical robot control, simulation, optimization, and automation. I have been working with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), a first-generation da Vinci surgical system, since 2021. I have contributed multiple hardware solutions to dVRK community, including but not limit to robot arm encoder replacement, robot arm brake replacement, viewer console linear actuator custom control enablement and surgical instrument lubrication & reactivation. I also take care of both hardware and software infrastructure development and maintenance for dVRK at WPI.

Currently, I am a visiting graduate scholar at LCSR JHU Robotics, where I conduct research on suturing tasks automation based on skills learned from demonstrations in simulation. Meanwhile, I also conduct research on accelerating surgery automation using sim-to-real method via creating more realistic simulation environments. In addition, I contribute to the software infrastructure construction of the AccelNet Surgical Robotics Challenge, which is an online challenge in simulation with following physical implementation aims to advance the state-of-the-art in suturing automation using dVRK. Additionally, I design frameworks for customized controller teleoperation, robot motion recording and replaying using ROS. Moreover, I also build realistic models for 6D pose estimation using deep learning and Pytorch.

Previously, I was a robotic intern at Philips, where I designed a synthetic motion simulator with GUI in Python using 3D DICOM data as the only input, and improved the image refreshing rate by over 30 times.

I have a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University, and a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology with senior-year exchange experience to University of California, Berkeley. I have also completed multiple online courses and certifications in machine learning and IRB trainings. I am proficient in Python, C++, MATLAB and familiar with both Linux and Windows development environments. I also have experience with ROS, Blender, VTK, ITK, VMTK, and Magic Leap 1& Xbox controller integration with robots. I am fluent in English and Chinese, and have strong communication and collaboration skills.

I am actively seeking for 2025 full-time position or internships in robotics, simulation, or AI-related fields.
