<p class="page-description">
  My research focuses on surgical robotics, with an emphasis on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK).
  I work on developing high-fidelity simulation environments, multi-modal data collection systems,
  dynamic model identification, and AI-driven perception and automation for surgical robotics applications.
