Outside of robotics research, I've developed a passion for cooking. Here's a showcase of some dishes I've prepared over the years.

## About My Cooking

Cooking has become one of my favorite ways to unwind after long hours in the lab. There's something satisfying about the precision and creativity involved in preparing a good meal - it's almost like engineering, but edible!

I particularly enjoy:
- **Asian Cuisine**: Growing up in Beijing, I learned many traditional Chinese cooking techniques from my family
- **Fusion Dishes**: Combining different culinary traditions to create something new
- **Weekend Projects**: More elaborate dishes that require time and patience

## Tips for Fellow Grad Students

1. **Meal Prep**: Cook in batches on weekends to save time during the week
2. **Simple Ingredients**: Master a few versatile ingredients and techniques
3. **Share with Labmates**: Cooking for others is more rewarding than cooking alone
