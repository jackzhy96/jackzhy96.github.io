  </div>
</div>

## Tips & Lessons Learned

Share what you learned:

1. **Timing matters** - The eggs need exactly 6.5 minutes for that perfect runny yolk
2. **Patience is key** - Good broth takes at least 4 hours
3. **Fresh noodles** - They make a huge difference compared to dried ones

> **Pro tip:** Bloom your aromatics in oil before adding to the broth for extra depth of flavor.

## Final Thoughts

Wrap up with your reflections. Would you do it again? What would you change next time?
