## Overview

Course project implementing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) using multi-scale constraint Kalman filter for robust state estimation.

## Technical Details

- Implemented multi-scale constraint Kalman filter for sensor fusion
- Combined visual features with IMU data for accurate pose estimation
- Developed algorithms for handling scale ambiguity in monocular vision
