## Overview

Course project implementing FaceSwap deep learning algorithms and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction.

## Technical Details

- Implemented FaceSwap using deep neural networks for face detection and replacement
- Developed NeRF implementation for 3D scene representation from 2D images
- Explored volumetric rendering techniques for photorealistic novel view synthesis
