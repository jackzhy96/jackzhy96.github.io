## Overview

Course project focused on designing and implementing adaptive robust control strategies for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) using ROS and Gazebo simulation environment.

## Technical Details

- Designed adaptive control algorithms to handle model uncertainties and disturbances
- Implemented the controller in ROS with Gazebo simulation
- Validated control performance through extensive simulation testing
