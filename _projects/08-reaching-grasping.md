## Overview

Graduate project at Boston University developing automation algorithms for reaching-to-grasping tasks using imitation learning.

## Technical Details

- Developed an automation algorithm for reaching-to-grasping task in V-REP simulation using imitation learning approach
- Leveraged joystick for the Baxter Robot end-effector control and human demonstration data collection
- Implemented learning from demonstration (LfD) algorithms for skill transfer
