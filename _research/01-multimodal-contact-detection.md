## Overview

This research investigates surgical robot tool-tissue contact detection using a multi-modal deep learning approach combining Multi-Scale Vision Transformer (ViT) and Mamba architectures.

## Key Contributions

- Lead and manage 8-person cross-functional team, delivering IRB-compliant data collection and analysis that accelerated publication timeline and demo readiness
- Build time-synchronized multi-modal data collection pipeline (vision + kinematics + sensor) and large (100+ trajectories) ex-vivo dataset
- Enable a novel kinematic projection approach and downstream optical flow/depth estimation using deep learning
- Design and implement a custom capacitive contact sensor to obtain the ground truth of tool-tissue contact
- Integrate a modern endoscope with the dVRK seamlessly, enabling high-quality image data acquisition
- Design a novel data annotation application with graphic user interface using PyQt for manual label annotations
- The data collection pipeline has been employed for efforts on Open-X-Embodiment
