## Overview

Development of high-fidelity digital twin environments for surgical suturing scenes, utilized for NSF AccelNet Surgical Robotics Challenges.

## Key Contributions

- Develop high-fidelity environments with realistic dynamic feedback for suturing execution on an open-source 3D simulation platform (AMBF), utilized for NSF 2021-2022 & 2023-2024 AccelNet Surgical Robotics Challenges
- Scan the real-world suturing training phantoms using MRI and import the segmented 3D models into the simulation environment
- Build photorealistic dVRK surgical instrument simulation models, sharing the models with the dVRK community
- Construct high-fidelity digital twin for suturing scenes in NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim
