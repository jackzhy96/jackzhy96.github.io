## Overview

This research develops novel approaches for force estimation and gravity compensation of the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) Patient Side Manipulator using model-based and learning-based hybrid methods.

## Key Contributions

- Develop a novel force estimation approach for the robot under trocar interaction using a hybrid model combined the model-based approach and the learning-based approach, **reducing the estimation errors by 30%**
- Implement the dynamic model identification and gravity compensation of dVRK Classic/Si Patient Side Manipulator using convex optimization approaches, **reducing the static control errors by 73%**
