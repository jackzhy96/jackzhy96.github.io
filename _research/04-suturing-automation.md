## Overview

Implementation of imitation learning algorithms for automating surgical suturing tasks in simulation and on physical robots.

## Key Contributions

- Implement imitation learning algorithms for suturing automation in simulation, achieving **95% success rate for task completion**, task generality on the order of **91.5%** and **20% less task execution time**
- Develop a novel pipeline for synchronized data collection and conduct user study for human demonstration acquisition using the physical dVRK
- Data subsequently utilized for building a 2024 NeurIPS-published dataset to support surgical policy learning
