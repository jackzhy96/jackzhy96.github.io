## Overview

Development of deep learning approaches for real-time markerless surgical instrument tracking and 6D pose estimation.

## Key Contributions

- Develop a novel deep learning approach for real-time markerless suturing needle 6D pose estimation in simulation, achieving average errors of **1.76 mm and 8.55 degrees**
- Develop an autonomous synthetic data generation pipeline using the high-fidelity simulation environment in the AMBF simulator
- Employ invisible UV/IR dye for ground truth labeling, subsequently utilized to construct a novel dataset for markerless dVRK surgical instruments pose estimation and tracking
