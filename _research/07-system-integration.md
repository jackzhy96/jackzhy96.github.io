## Overview

Research on integrating various sensing modalities and control interfaces with the da Vinci Research Kit.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a novel teleoperation approach using sEMG biofeedback signals
- Integrated a photo-acoustic probe with a dVRK instrument and installed on the dVRK Patient Side Manipulator (PSM)
- Constructed the kinematic model for the custom instrument to enable teleoperation and script-based control
- Developed the synchronized autonomous scanning system using ROS communication for image overlay
- Enabled teleoperation for dVRK PSMs with multiple common haptic devices, such as Phantom Omni and Razer Hydra controller, subsequently utilized in a dVRK-based AR measurement system
