## Overview

Development of automated walking strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons using imitation learning approaches.

## Key Contributions

- Developed an automated walking strategy for lower-limb exoskeleton in simulation using imitation learning approach
- Implemented Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) to find the optimal weight matrix for control
