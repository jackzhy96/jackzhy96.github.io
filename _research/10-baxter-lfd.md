## Key Contributions

- Developed an automation algorithm for reaching-to-grasping task in V-REP simulation using imitation learning approach
- Leveraged joystick for the Baxter Robot end-effector control and human demonstration data collection
- Implemented learning from demonstration (LfD) algorithms for skill transfer
